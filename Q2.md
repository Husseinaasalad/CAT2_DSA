1) Memory Allocation
    Arrays allocate memory in a single, contiguous block(contiguous memory) 
    while
    Linked lists nodes can be scattered throughout the memory.

 2) Perfomance
    Access time for arrays are constant while linked lists are linear.
    Arrays have a very fast iteration speed due to cache locality while linked lists are slower due to pointer chasing

 3) Insertion and Deletion Operations
    Arrays require shifting elements for both beginning and middle insertion while linked lists update references only in the beginning and insertion O(n) to find position + O(1) to insert in the middle.


    Arrays require shifting elements for both beginning and middle deletion while linked lists update head reference in the beginning and O(n) to find + O(1) to delete in the end deletion
